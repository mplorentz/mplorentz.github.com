This is the beginning of my blog. It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). It is not [federated](https://www.gnu.org/software/social/) or [self-hosted](https://tent.io), but I would like it to be. It might be more of a traditional blog, or more of the [micro](https://micro.blog) type. I'm not sure yet.

I want to use it as a journal of personal projects and a place to remember things that I think are cool. I would like to interact with my friends and family through it, but I'm not sure how I want that to happen just yet. Instead of waiting until I've figured out exactly what I will do with my blog, _I shipped it_. It will never be perfect, and if I wait until I know it will be it will probably never get made.
