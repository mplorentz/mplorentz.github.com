I need a new social network. I'm tired of Twitter and Reddit. I've been off Facebook for years. For a few years I was really happy on [Tent](https://micro.cupcake.io/profile), but the small community there has shrunk to the point where sometimes days go by with nothing posted at all. 

I want a social network where the motivations of the creators align with the users. I want my data to be in an open format that I own, not a silo that someone else owns. I want a community that is open to sharing an interacting with ideas, even ones they don't agree with.

I think there are a lot of people who want this too. I know because they are shipping things:
* [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)
* [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog)
* [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork)
* [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/)
* [Rotonde](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/#rotonde)
* [Akasha](https://akasha.world/)

Now I just need to figure out how to pick one. For now I will try to set up cross-posting from this blog to as many of them as possible, and use each a little bit to see which I like best.
