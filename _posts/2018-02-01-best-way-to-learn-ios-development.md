I get asked this question a lot. I've never had a great answer. In fact, I've often told people to ask my friend Josh. Well, it turns out he's just done a round up of apps, videos, and courses that are great for someone who wants to learn iOS development. From now on I'll be referring them to [his post](http://roadfiresoftware.com/2018/01/whats-the-best-way-to-learn-ios-development-with-swift/).
