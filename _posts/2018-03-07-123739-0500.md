Development has stopped on [XVim](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim2), the most popular vim plugin for Xcode, since Apple rewrote SourceKit last year. Iâ€™m ready to start forking over cash to get things back to normal, because I rely on this tool to get my work done every day. If you want to help out, consider [pledging some money](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/55909442-selecting-text-with-mouse-does-not-select-it-in-vim) on BountySource.
