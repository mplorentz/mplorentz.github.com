I just renamed the `/blog` on my website to `/weblog`. I think it sounds cooler and fits better with what I want to do here. The term “blog” has a lot of connotations nowadays. Blogs often have a theme, or they are for company announcements, or thousand word thinkpieces. But this place is more of a logbook of what I’m doing on the web. The audience is me as much as anyone else, and  I’m not trying to curate my online persona to be anything specific.

[The term “weblog” is supposedly a precursor to “blog”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_blogging), and it hearkens back to a simpler era of the Internet. A time that was better in many ways, some of which I think we can get [back](https://ia.net/topics/take-the-power-back/) to. So here’s to trying.
