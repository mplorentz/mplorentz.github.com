This is pretty cool. [Micro.blog now supports the ActivityPub protocol](https://www.manton.org/2018/11/07/microblog-mastodon.html), so it's now possible to follow people from across the two networks. I haven't really been using either network much lately, but my own posts here on my website end up on both. I would love to make [mattlorentz.com](http://mattlorentz.com) ActivityPub-aware, but I think I'd have to move away from a static site.
