# Getting Rid of Google - 2019 Edition

Back in [2010] Google ruled the internet. They also held all the keys to my digital life. They had all my emails, web searches, phone calls, texts, directions to every new place I went, calendar events, most of the documents I worked on, and many of the websites I visited.

It’s now 2018. Google still rules most of the internet. But they have much less power over my online experience and they are making a lot less money off me.

Without diving too much into it: I feel morally obligated to be part of the current privacy crusade. In [2010] I decided to make a commitment to cut Google out of my life. I was inspired by the Snowden revelations and [Steven Frank’s post] about making the same commitment. But at the time it seemed like an impossible task. Some services had easy alternatives, but others had nothing of similar quality and price. 

In this post I want to review all the Google services I was using then and see what I have replaced them with today. I also want to evaluate who owns my data today.

## Gmail

Getting off Gmail is hard and easy at the same time. There are hundreds of decent mail providers out there, and picking a good one is not hard - if you are willing to fork over a few dollars a month. This was a hard commitment to make when I was in college, but I don’t regret it. 

I switched to the privacy conscious and non-US based (RIP [Lavabit]?) [KolabNow]. I also changed my address to one at my own domain name, which is more important these days since [your email is the key to your digital life]. Now I can switch hosts without changing my address if I ever become unhappy with the current one, which is a really good option to have in such an important system.

Some of my friends and relatives still use my old address, so I have to keep it around. That and most email providers want a backup email for account recovery. So the old Gmail address sticks around, but there is a very low volume of mail coming through. Of course [Google still has a large portion of my email], but I’m doing as much as I can to fight it. 

I should consider deleting the Gmail account altogether and paying for (or self-hosting?) a second email for account recovery purposes.

## GChat

Back in 2010 instant messages were still a very important medium for me. Now if I need to chat with someone I usually end up using iMessage/SMS for personal conversations and Slack for work. iMessage is _supposedly_ end-to-end encrypted, but SMS aren’t very private at all. I’ve used several other types of chat software over the years like [IRC], [Signal], [Matrix], [Keybase], etc., but the problem with picking a chat platform is that popularity is usually the deciding factor.

I should use Signal more.

## Google Search

There’s a reason Google is a verb, and that reason is Search. I use [Duck Duck Go] as the default search engine on all my devices these days, but for many queries I have to use the `!g` command to forward my question to Google. Duck Duck Go just doesn’t understand what I am asking for - especially when I’m searching for programming questions.

Maybe there are search engines that give Google’s results but do more to obfuscate my identity. Or maybe there are better websites than Duck Duck Go. I haven’t looked. I should.

## Google Voice

Google Voice had one killer feature for me: the ability to send and receive SMS messages from my laptop. iMessage gained this feature in [2012] which made it easy to get rid of.

## Google Maps

Google Maps was one of the hardest products to replace in [2010]. MapQuest was already in decline and Apple Maps and [OpenStreetMap] hadn’t taken off yet.

These days I use Apple Maps. Exchanging Google for Apple is a small win but not ideal. The only privacy-respecting alternative I know of is OpenStreetMap, which I have tried very hard to use. But it just doesn’t cut it. Given a phone, a navigation app, and the name of a destination I often can’t get directions with OpenStreetMap in under a minute. Trying to convert a destination’s name to a longitude/latitude is really hard and not always possible. 

I will try OpenStreetMap again in the future, and maybe try some of the closed-source navigation apps I have spurned so far.

## Google Plus

Just kidding. Nobody used Google Plus.

## Google Calendar

Today I use iCloud to sync my calendars between devices. I think  KolabNow, who already hosts my email, hosts calendars as well but I’ve never tried it. I should.

## Google Docs

Google Docs was the only document editor with really good concurrent editing support in 2010. 

## Google Reader
## Google Ads
