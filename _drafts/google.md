# Getting Rid of Google - 2018 Edition

Back in [2010] Google ruled the internet. They also held all the keys to my digital life. They had all my emails, web searches, phone calls, texts, directions to every new place I went, calendar events, many of the documents I wrote for school, and many of the websites I read. 

It’s now 2018. Google still rules most of the internet. But they have much less power over my online experience and they are making much less money off me.

Without diving too much into it: I feel morally obligated to be part of the current privacy crusade. In [2010] I decided to make a commitment to cut Google out of my life. I was inspired by the Snowden revelations and [Steven Frank’s post] about making the same commitment. But at the time it seemed like an impossible task. Some services had easy alternatives, but others had nothing of similar quality and price. 

In this post I want to review all the Google services I was using then and see what I have replaced them with today. I also want to be real about who can see my data today.

## Gmail

Getting off Gmail is hard and easy at the same time. There are hundreds of decent mail providers out there, and picking a good one is not hard - if you are willing to fork over a few dollars a month. This was a hard commitment to make when I was in college, but I don’t regret it. 

I switched to the privacy conscious and non-US based (remember [that one mail company]?) [KolabNow]. I also changed my address to one at my own domain name, which is more important these days since [your email is the key to your digital life]. Now I can switch providers without changing my address if I ever become unhappy with my current, which is a really good option to have in such an important system.

Some of my friends and relatives still use my old address, so I have to keep it around. That and most email providers want a backup email for account recovery. So the old Gmail address sticks around, but there is a very low volume of mail coming through. Of course [Google still has a large portion of my email], but I’m doing as much as I can to fight it.

## GChat

Back in 2010 instant messages were still a very important medium. Now if I need to chat with someone I usually end up using iMessage/SMS for personal conversations and Slack for work. iMessage is _supposedly_ end-to-end encrypted, but we all know SMSs aren’t very private at all. I’ve used several other chat programs over the year like [IRC], [Signal], [Matrix], [Keybase], etc., but the problem with picking a chat platform is that popularity is usually the deciding factor.

Replaced with: iMessage, SMS, Slack

## Google Search

There’s a reason Google is a verb, and it’s because of Search. I use [Duck Duck Go] as the default search engine on all my devices, but for many queries I have to use the `!g` command to forward my question to Google. Duck Duck Go just doesn’t understand what I am asking for - especially when I’m searching for programming questions.

Maybe there are search engines that give Google’s results but do more to obfuscate my identity. Or maybe there are better websites than Duck Duck Go. I haven’t looked. I should.

## Google Voice

Google Voice had one killer feature for me: the ability to send and receive SMS messages from my laptop. iMessage gained this feature in [2012] which made it easy to get rid of.

Google Maps was one of the hardest products to replace in [2010].

Haha. Nobody used Google Plus.

## Google Calendar
