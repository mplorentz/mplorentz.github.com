# Finding Flow as a Remote Worker

## Intro
- Inspired by Huberman 90-minute work bouts
- Goal is to get into a flow programming state at least once a day
- Working remotely makes it easier to control distractions in some ways but harder in others. 
	- For example co-workers can’t see visual cues that you are focused.
	- But you can also shut off all notifications.

Flow state is an incredibly productive and rewarding place to find yourself. I think all programmers know the conditions required to find flow: a challenging problem, no distractions, and plenty of mental energy. I have always tried to create these conditions in my work day, but it wasn’t until I recently listened to an episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast that I considered *scheduling* flow into my day. Andrew Huberman talks about his daily routine and it inspired me to try to be more intentional about getting into a flow state every day.

## My Routine
My current routine includes a scheduled 90 minute “work bout” in the morning, and sometimes another in the afternoon. The morning bout is scheduled to coincide with the part of my circadian rhythm when it is easiest for my brain to focus.

The bout itself is basically 3 “pomodoro” sessions during which I mute almost all notifications. 

We have a lot of software tools these days to help us manage 

## Goals
- Only interrupted for emergencies
- Communicate flow to coworkers and family

## Implementation
- Slack
- Pomodoro Timer (Flow)
- macOS/iOS Notification Center
- Alfred
- Close door
