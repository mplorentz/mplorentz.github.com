# I made a linux

Over the past week I have been installing Arch Linux on my desktop at home. Why? I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I hate myself. Maybe 2018 is the year of linux on the desktop. Or maybe I've forgotten why I decided to take up residence in Apple's walled garden, and I just need to see for myself what is on the outside.

See, I've been an Apple fan since my grade school friend had me over to play Animal Crossing and showed me his dad's new iMac G4. I spent all my savings on a Macbook in 2008, got my first iPhone in 2010, and was known as the "iPad guy" my freshman year of college because I owned one of the first-generation models. And I've spent the beginning of my career developing for iOS. 

I love the balance of form and function. I love the intersection of technology and the humanities. I love shelling out extra money to get hardware and software that I trust, that lasts a long time, with amazing customer service, and an ecosystem of third-party products with the same values. Because technology is not an end in it itself, it is a bicycle for the mind.

So why in the world would I want an operating system where I have to choose my network manager? Where I have to read a tutorial any time I want to change simple preferences? Where the front page of the wiki explains that this operating system is _not_ user-friendly, and requires a do-it-yourself attitude? The reason is certainly complex, but here are a few factors that I can articulate:

# Factors

## I am not the same user 
When I became an Apple user, I was a kid. My primary occupation was school. I thought I wanted to be a teacher, or maybe a doctor.

I'm now in my mid-20s and the lionshare of my energy and creativity is spent making software on the computer. And I spend a lot of time thinking about what makes good software, and I have a lot of opinions about how it should work. 

* I have a lot more skill

## Apple is not the same company

So when when my network manager gets flakey I care. A lot. I care when my laptop can't wake from sleep reliably. I care when I have to reboot my computer daily to troubleshoot whatever decided to not work today. I care when 

## Free software is awesome
## Privacy is under attack
